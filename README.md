# Intro

_FratAttack_ is a drinking board-game with two goals:

* Save your fraternity from the evil mind-controlling aliens that have invaded during last-nights party.
* Getting hammered in the process.

Luckily, the aliens mind-control does not work on people under the influence. Now that you think about it, that's probably why they attacked the fraternities first. Once they fall, who could stand in their way to world [domination] [1]. It's your task to defeat the aliens before the other players (because, glory).

The gameplay itself is pretty easy. Think of _FratAttack_ as a paper version of party games such as Mario Party, which also happens to include drinking a lot.

[1]: # "At least you assume that's what they want. Maybe they just want to bring world-peace and elevate humanity to the next level of existence, who knows."

# Objective
To save humanity, you must collect alien materials and construct the weapons used to destroy them!
 The first player to reach a set amount of weapons wins the game.

# What You'll Need

To play this game, you will need:

* The printed out materials of the game (board, cards and scoring cards)
* A die and some figures that represent the players on the board.
* A drink to sip, e.g. Beer
* Spirits and shot glasses
* 3 or more people

#Preparation

Sort the cards into two piles: Those which are event cards (they have an icon that says 'Event' in the top left) and those that are not.
Shuffle both piles, and place them on the corresponding spaces on the board.

Each player puts their figure on a _Frat House_ square of their choice. The player who is least drunk starts with the first turn.

# Gameplay

Players take turns rolling a die and moving on the board. Whenever your figures moves to a square (whether it's because it is your turn, or because the game told you to move in some other way), the moved player has to do what the square he landed on says. Squares roughly fall into three categories.

* Some squares may simply tell the player to drink or receive some materials. Do that.
* At _Frat Houses_ you can trade your materials in for weapons. You need 20 materials for one weapon.
* On squares with a card icon, you need to draw a card from the indicated pile.

# Cards
Each card can be either an _active_ or a _status_ card, indicated by an icon in the lower right corner of the card. 
The effect of an active card are applied once when the card is played. Status cards are placed infront of players and apply as long as they remain there.
The effect a card has described as a text on the card.

Cards are put into two piles on the board based on whether they are _Event_ or _Action_ cards. 

* Event cards are played immediately when they are drawn.
* Action cards are drawn covertly and are kept in hand. They can be played at any time by paying the cost in materials indicated on the top left of the card. A player can only hold 5 action cards at once. If he has more than 5, he needs to discard or play action cards until he has 5 again. If he chooses to discard a card, the player does not need to pay the cost in materials but instead takes that many drinks of beer.

# Contributing

If you'd like to help improve this game, there are several ways.

* We are always looking for new card ideas. If you have any that you think might be fun, let us know!
* Found a mistake? Tell us.
* Nothing is written in stone. Got a cool flavor text or name for a card that already has one? If it's cool, We'll probably change it.
* Art. I'm terrible at designing the graphics that can make a game so much better. If you want to contribute designs for cards, board, etc you are more than welcome!

The easiest way to let us know about your ideas is to open an issue on the bugtracker!
