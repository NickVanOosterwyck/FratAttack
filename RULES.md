#Rules

In _FratAttack_, it's your goal to save humanity from the evil aliens that have invaded your fraternity. For that, you must collect alien materials and construct the weapons used to destroy them!
 The first player to reach three weapons wins the game.

##Preparation

Sort the cards into two piles: Those which are event cards (they have an icon that says 'Event' in the top left) and those that are not.
Shuffle both piles, and place them face down on the corresponding spaces on the board.

Each player puts their figure on a _Frat House_ square of their choice. The player who is least drunk starts with the first turn.

## Gameplay

Players take turns rolling a die and moving on the board. Whenever your figures moves to a square (whether it's because it is your turn, or because the game told you to move in some other way), the moved player has to do what the square he landed on says. Squares fall into one of three categories.

* Some squares may simply tell the player to drink or receive some materials. Do that.
* When passing the _Frat House_ you can trade your materials in for weapons. You need 20 materials for one weapon. If you stop exactly at the _Frat House_, all other players drink.
* On squares with a card icon, you need to draw a card from the indicated pile.

## Cards
Each card can be either an _active_ or a _status_ card, indicated by an icon in the lower right corner of the card. 
The effect of an active card are applied once when the card is played. Status cards are placed in front of players and apply as long as they remain there.
The effect a card has is described as text on the card.

Cards are put into two piles on the board based on whether they are _Event_ or _Action_ cards. 

* Event cards are played immediately when they are drawn.
* Action cards are drawn covertly and are kept in hand. They can be played at any time by paying the cost in materials indicated on the top left of the card. A player can only hold 5 action cards at once. If he has more than 5, he needs to discard or play action cards until he has 5 again. If he chooses to discard a card, the player does not need to pay the cost in materials but instead takes that many drinks of beer.

## Additional Rules

* Whenever a player finishes their drink, they may draw an action card or receive three materials.
* Always round down, unless a card says otherwise.
* If in doubt about the rules, do whatever results in more drinking.
